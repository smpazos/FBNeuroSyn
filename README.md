# FBNeuronSpice
This repository contains minimal working example of the floating bulk avalanche neural-mimicking device. 

Language is LTSpice, but easily adaptable to other SPICE releases, as it only employs native device models.

The transistor model is extracted from Predictive Technology Models for a 130 nm node and reduced for compatibility with LTSpice. These are not unique to any process and only exemplary models for the general behaviour of a device in such technology.
